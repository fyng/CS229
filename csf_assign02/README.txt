Contributions: 
Feiyang implemented most of the c functions in `c_hexfuncs.c` and `c_hexmain.c`. Feiyang assisted in developing 'hex_to_printable` in assembly. 

Tae Wan prototyped 'hex_to_printable` in assembly and debugged the c functions to satisfy all I/O tests. Tae Wan also laid the foundation for assembly functions. 

Both collaborated to debug assembly function `hex_format_byte_as_hex` during office hour.
